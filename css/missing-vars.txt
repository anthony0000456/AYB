Variables used in CSS but NOT defined in css/theme.css (generated):

From scanning css/style.css and css/main.css against css/theme.css definitions.

Used but missing (candidates for safe aliases):
- --white (defined as alias)
- --dark (defined as alias)
- --light-gray (defined as alias)
- --primary-color (defined as alias)
- --white-color (defined as alias)
- --light-color (defined as alias)
- --dark-color (defined as alias)
- --text-white (defined as alias)
- --gray (defined as alias)
- --text (defined as alias)
- --shadow (defined as alias)

Note: The current `css/theme.css` already defines aliases for the common names used elsewhere. No additional missing variables were found that are not already aliased.

If you want, I can automatically add more aliases or canonicalize variable names across the stylesheets.
